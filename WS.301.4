Agile Framework Attributes
Focus on People	Expect professionalism to be used to produce high quality outcomes.

Working Software	Agile aims to deliver high-quality working
(functioning with needed functionality) software products.
Flexibility	Agility: The ability to adjust to changing conditions.
Customer Involvement	Customers or User representatives are expected to be involved, give opinions and feedback, and help to prioritize next steps.
Multi
disciplinary cooperating teams	Each Scrum team must have specific skills to successfully deliver the project.  By having each member with a broad but shallow understanding of many topics and a deep understanding of one or two topics (for which they will be considered the expert).  This type of ability/skill-set distribution is called a T-shaped skill set.  Enterprises always look for a T-shaped skill set model when selecting development team members.
Trust	Trust is the basic ingredient to be able to deliver the requested quality.

Methodology	Framework
•	Scrum has no exhaustive and formal prescriptions on how to design and plan the work, actions, and behaviors of all players involved in product development against time.
•	Scrum is also not a methodology.	Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions. It is ideal for complex product development, and is iterative and incremental.
