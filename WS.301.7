Estimation 	The act of determining (guessing) the expected size of something.   In Scrum, estimating helps to set expectations as to the amount of work that can be performed or the length of time until something is finished.



   3 types of estimation   	 	When this occurs  	 	Unit of measure
Affinity Estimation 	Portfolio Planning 	T-shirt sizes
Blind Estimation 	Product
 Backlog Grooming
 	Story points / ideal days
Affinity Estimating 	Sprint Planning 	Ideal hours / effort-hours




Scrum Roles Involved in Estimation

Daily Standup
Purpose
 inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog.
3 Questions
What have you do since the last meeting?
What are you planning to do before the next meeting?
Do you experience any obstacles?
Rules
The Daily Scrum optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal. Every day, the Development Team should understand how it intends to work together as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment by the end of the Sprint. The Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for detailed discussions, or to adapt, or replan, the rest of the Sprint’s work.




Pair Programming

Ensure that everyone knows what the code does.
Collective code ownership!

Two team members work together in single task.
Driver and navigator

Constant reflection (real time reviewing).

Reduction of noise.
